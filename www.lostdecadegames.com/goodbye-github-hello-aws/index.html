		<h2>Goodbye GitHub, Hello AWS</h2>

<div class="section text blog">
<h2 id="the-honeymoon">The Honeymoon</h2>

<p>If you follow this blog at all you probably know that we love <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. It’s a great service with outstanding UI. GitHub is the reason that I now use git for all my source control needs.</p>

<p>When Matt and I <a href="/our-new-blog-is-running-on-jekyll/">redesigned the Lost Decade Games website</a> we wanted to have a setup with easy deployment and scaling. <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> was a service that fit this bill nicely. Pages hosts your static site (generated via <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>) by simply pushing some code to GitHub.</p>

<p>Given that we were already paying customers, we got custom domain name support as well. Life was good for a time.</p>

<h2 id="the-breakup">The Breakup</h2>

<p>Before long we started hitting some walls with GitHub &amp; Pages.</p>

<p>For starters, GitHub’s pricing model is ruthless. $25 a month gets you 10 private repos, which I feel is a complete ripoff. Want more repos? The next plan is $50/month for 20 private repos! Even as a two-person indie shop we hit the 10 private repo limit quite quickly.</p>

<p>In response, we started moving our inactive private repos to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> which boasts unlimited private repos and monetizes on collaborator count. BitBucket is basically a bad clone of GitHub, which is fine, but we ended up having to deal with two separate repository hosts, and that was too painful to put up with.</p>

<p>Pages is semi-unreliable, as well. This isn’t a direct criticism of GitHub; we’re aware that keeping services up while <a href="https://github.com/blog/1036-about-this-week-s-availability">under DDoS attacks</a> is tough. But the fact of the matter is that too often we couldn’t update our website because Pages was down.</p>

<p>One day pushes to our website repo stopped working. No error notifications. No push. Nothing. Turns out that if your build doesn’t complete within 5 minutes, it fails silently. Bugs happen of course, but I’d much rather be able to jump on the server and figure things out than fire off emails to support and hope for a prompt response.</p>

<p>There are a few other nit-picky issues, but by this time we had decided that we were in dire need of a new solution for our git repo and website hosting.</p>

<h2 id="the-rebound">The Rebound</h2>

<p>After falling out of love with GitHub I made a list of important requirements for our hosting needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easily scalable! I don’t want to worry about spinning up new boxes to handle load for a static website.</li>
  <li>Unlimited (or a large number of) private repos</li>
  <li>Single command deployment with <code>git push</code></li>
  <li>Cost effective!</li>
  <li>Control! Jekyll extensions, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had heard about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) before, but for some reason I never thought it a practical solution for a company as small as ours.</p>

<p>Thankfully, AWS offers a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">Free Usage Tier</a> which lets you get your feet wet with some generous limits. Taking advantage of this free tier I began messing around with various hosting solutions using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>.</p>

<p>Straight away I spun up an EC2 micro instance which acted as our git/web server. In the <code>post-receive</code> hook for our website’s repo I created a simple shell script which builds the site via Jekyll and pushes the result to the Apache document root. The Jekyll wiki has a nice <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Deployment">section on deployment</a> with similar scripts.</p>

<p>Not bad! We had git-push-to-deploy working as well as unlimited repos. However, I felt that the web server and git server shouldn’t be combined. Running an EC2 instance for both servers isn’t very cost efficient, either. Luckily, I stumbled upon the fact that <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/02/host-your-static-website-on-amazon-s3.html">static websites can be hosted on S3</a>!</p>

<p>Hosting the website on S3 is great for a couple big reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No need to run Apache on an EC2 instance. Less complication and less expensive!</li>
  <li>Scaling is taken care of by S3, no messing around with EC2 load balancers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Our website is now hosted out of S3 and if you’re reading this post things are holding together pretty well!</p>

<p>GitHub is a great product but it’s not geared towards a small business like ours. We’ll still be hosting <a href="https://github.com/lostdecade">our public code</a> there, but I’m much happier with our new stack.</p>

<p>All that said, there are bound to be issues with AWS which I’ll likely blog about in the future as we encounter them.</p>

<p>Do you have a preferred setup for hosting static websites? Let us know in the comments!</p>
