</div>

<p>Less than a week after <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/an-onslaught-of-onslaught-news/">Onslaught! Arena went open source</a>, it took home 3rd place in the <a href="http://www.pokki.com/1up/">Pokki 1up Game Developer Contest</a>. This got us tickets to <a href="http://gdconf.com/">GDC</a>, a day of awesome fun with the Pokki team, and (last but not least), a cool <strong>$7,000</strong>. (If you listen to <a href="/lostcast/">our podcast</a> you know that <a href="http://localhost:4000/lostcast-episode-10-indiependence-day/">we’re indie now</a> so this is a real stress-reliever for us!)</p>

<h2 id="developing-with-pokki">Developing with Pokki</h2>

<p>Gotta say, it was really easy to work with <a href="http://developers.pokki.com/">Pokki’s tech</a> (though granted, we already had a full working game, so all we had to do was stick it into their stack). <strong>It only took about an hour to integrate!</strong> Their platform is basically <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> stripped of its user interface, which means it’s very similar to developing within Google Chrome. This is great; familiar tools like the Web Inspector are at your fingertips.</p>

<p>We had to switch from mp3 to <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">ogg</a> for audio to work with Pokki. Can’t really blame them here, as who wants to worry about <a href="http://www.scirra.com/blog/64/why-you-shouldnt-use-mp3-in-your-html5-games">the crazy mp3 licenses</a>? I’ve got a handy <a href="https://github.com/richtaur/dotfiles/blob/master/belmont/bash_profile.sh#L13">VLC-based CLI script</a> I use that made the conversion easier. Audio performance is also buggy and inconsistent (but we all know this is a problem with Chromium and will go away eventually).</p>

<p>We also had to include a minimize button in order to be accepted into their gallery. This was a straight-forward process and only took a few minutes.</p>

<p>What about those other games, hm? First place went to <a href="http://www.nutcasenightmare.com/">Nicklaus Liow</a> for his delightful game <a href="http://www.pokki.com/1up/#4horsemen">Four Horsemen</a>. It’s a simple puzzle game with a quirky theme and a ton of polish. He really knocked this one out of the park, and that song-and-dance tutorial really takes the edge off of teaching the player to play. Really well executed.</p>

<p>Second place went to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gabumba">Evgeni Gordejev</a> and his wacky alien-physics game <a href="http://www.pokki.com/download/?name=Tupsu&amp;etag=Pokki_Tupsu">Tupsu</a>. Evgeni was a particularly interesting developer to chat with, as this was the first game he’d developed. He also has a C++ background but chose to program in Java using Google’s cross-platform game library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/playn/">playn</a>.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-pokki">Thanks Pokki!</h2>

</div>

<p>We spent most of Tuesday chatting with the Pokki team. They’re a really smart, impressive group of developers who have a history of making impactful technology (some of them having founded <a href="http://www.divx.com/">DivX</a>). They’re <strong>extremely</strong> developer-friendly, which obviously we are thrilled about. Their plans for Pokki are numerous and ambitious, and I believe that they have the skill and experience do accomplish whatever they put their resources toward. Looking forward to seeing what’s next!</p>
