		<h2>A Simple Guide to Game Development Contests</h2>

<h2>How do you find out about these things?</h2>

<p>
	I hear about game development contests relatively often,
	but it's almost always too late to enter.
	I end up just being frustrated and wonder:
	"Where do people find out about these contests?"
</p>

<p>
	We've recently been more fortunate and have been able to successfully enter
	<a href="/boing-boing-contest-post-mortem-onslaught-0">two</a>
	<a href="/onslaught-v02-freeplay-awards">contests</a>.
	And here's how we finally were able to find out about them in time:
	<strong>by subscribing to insane amount of gaming news</strong>.
	Below is a list of game development related news sites, feeds and other resources.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Do you know of any additional resources for game development contest news?
	Please let me know in the comments and I'll happily add them to the list.</em>
</p>

<p>
	So now that you <strong>know</strong> about these contests coming up &#8230;
</p>

<h2>How do you know if you should enter?</h2>

<p>
	So you found out about an upcoming contest and you're interested.
	Should you try to put a game together to enter into the contest?
	This is a difficult question.
	First:
	<strong>is it a good fit?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	If the contest requires that your game is built on
	<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>
	but all of your experience is with
	<a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">pygame</a>,
	that's probably a good sign to forget about the
	contest and get back to whatever else you were doing.
</p>

<p>
	It <em>could</em> be that the contest is so amazing that it's worth derailing your current project,
	starting a new one, or learning a new language,
	but I'd seriously advise against that.
	I think it's a good adage to <strong>finish what you've started</strong>
	and <strong>play to your strengths</strong>.
	You might be able to enter a contest outside of your skill set, but you'd probably make a better game just for yourself for fun.
	So I guess what you should ask yourself is:
</p>

<h2>Will you benefit from entering?</h2>

<a
	class="before"
	href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4844819097/"
><img alt="Onslaught! 'box art'" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4844819097_f169bb11f9_m.jpg"></a>

<p>
	On the surface, this is another way of asking, <strong>Could you win?</strong>
	The benefit of winning many of these contests is clear: for example,
	with the recently-announced
	<a href="http://www.activision.com/index.html#sweepstakes|en_US">Activision contest</a>,
	the grand prize is something like <em>$100k</em> and a publishing deal. That's pretty major!
	But keep in mind that with a prize like that, you're going to get some very polished entries by some veteran game developers.
	The competition will be intense.
</p>

<p>
	So, maybe you can win and maybe you can't;
	other benefits can arise from entering.
	For example, if you read our
	<a href="/boing-boing-contest-post-mortem-onslaught-0">postmortem on the Boing Boing contest</a>,
	you saw that we were driven by the hard, unchangeable deadline,
	which was great because we often can't find motivation.
	We also made a bunch of mistakes and learned from them, which is another beneficial side effect.
</p>

<p>
	Merely being involved in a contest can also get some much desired attention to your game.
	According to
	<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>,
	<a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> has referred over <em>1,500</em> people to our game
	<a href="http://lostdecadegamesapp.appspot.com/">Onslaught!</a>.
	That's not much from a big business perspective, but for a tiny and unknown team like ours, it's great!
</p>

<h2>Determining if a contest or promotion is shady</h2>

<p>
	So you found a contest, you figured it's worth your time for one reason or another, and now you're in!
	You want to enter.
	Just please do one more quick thing first: <strong>make sure the contest isn't shady</strong>.
	You can do that by <strong>reading the fine print and getting a second opinion</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	If you're seriously considering entering, it's probably worth your time to read the fine print.
	It's certainly not fun reading,
	but you could get into a bind otherwise: a single sentence could disqualify your game
	or remove your rights to your
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">intellectual property</a>.
	Fortunately, there are resources out there to help you.
</p>

<p>
	The guys over at
	<a href="http://wolfire.com/">Wolfire</a>
	often write about the bigger contests
	(<a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/06/Activision-Indie-Games-Competition">like they recently did</a>).
	For <em>that</em> particular contest, you can also get
	<a href="http://gameattorney.com/blog/?p=89">insight</a>
	from
	<a href="http://gameattorney.com/">Tom Buscaglia</a>:
	<a href="http://twitter.com/gameattorney">The Game Attorney</a> (a real attorney!).
</p>

<p>
	Now, if you can't <strong>find</strong> the fine print, that's a bad sign right there.
	A legitimate company running a "real" contest is going to have documentation to cover their asses.
	If you're just entering into a
	<a href="http://gamejolt.com/community/forums/topics/game-jolt-s-second-jam/613/">quick weekend contest</a>
	like the fine folks over at <a href="http://gamejolt.com/">Game Jolt</a> regularly hold, that's fine.
	But if there's supposedly a cash prize, and you're going to expend hard-earned time and/or money on your project,
	it had damned well better be legit.
</p>

<p>
	When in doubt, why not ask your
	<a href="http://forums.indiegamer.com/">indie game development peers</a>?
	Late last year I bumped into an interesting thread with the subject
	<a href="http://forums.indiegamer.com/showthread.php?t=18518">Indie Game Competition - $15k and possible publishing deals!</a>.
	What was interesting to me was
	<a href="http://forums.indiegamer.com/showpost.php?p=207401&amp;postcount=3">a post</a>
	that said:
</p>

<p><blockquote>
	And you still owe me over $250,000. I also found out I am not the only developer being scammed by Zoo Games, so this should be a warning to everyone here.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
	I'm not going to pretend to know what's going on there, but it doesn't <em>smell</em> right, know what I mean?
	For that reason, I'd have passed on that contest.
</p>

<h2>Decide quickly and move on with your development</h2>

<p>
	The most important thing is not to be affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">decision paralysis</a>.
	In the past I've spent an embarassing amount of time just <em>thinking</em> about these sort of contests.
	And in the end I never entered, so all I had to show for it was a ton of lost time.
	Think about it this way: <strong>you're probably going to keep making games either way</strong>,
	aren't you?
	So set aside a little time to determine if it's worth your while,
	then move on and get back to making games!
</p>

<p>
	Have I missed any important steps?
	Have you had any luck (good or bad) with these contests?
	Hope to hear from you in the comments.
