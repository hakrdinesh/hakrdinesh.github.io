      and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for
      commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've
      requested, when we have your permission, or under the following
      circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
        prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
        fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
        safety of any person, violations of <a
          href="http://orzota.com/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>, or as
        otherwise required by law.</li>
      <li>We transfer information about you if Orzota is acquired by or
        merged with another company. In this event, Orzota will notify
        you before information about you is transferred and becomes
        subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Information Gathering And Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When you register for our services, we may ask for information

        information. Users who sign up for the free account are not
        required to enter billing information.</li>
      <li>Orzota uses collected information for the following general
        purposes: products and services provision, billing,
        identification and authentication and services improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an
        anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a
        web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.</li>
      <li>Cookies are required to use the Orzota service.</li>
      <li>We use cookies to record current session information, but do
        not use permanent cookies. You are required to log in to your

    <h2>Types of Application Data We Collect</h2>
    Orzota may collect Application Data when you use our Service.
    "Application Data" means data about your use of our application,
    system data (such as software versions, etc.) about the clusters
    that are created and operated in, and other similar data related to
    your use of our service and it's performance. Application Data does
    not include the actual data that is stored and/or accessed in the
    clusters created by the Orzota Big Data Management platform. <br>
    <h2>Use of Your Application Data</h2>
    Application Data we collect is primarily used to display application
    information back to the account user. It is also used by Orzota
    personnel to answer questions that customers may have about their
    account and to develop and improve our products. Orzota may also
    aggregate Application Data across multiple accounts and use this
    data in technical or marketing collateral. <br>
    <h2>Disclosure of Your Application Data</h2>
    We may share your Application Data with third parties to provide
    technical support or to provide specific services, such as hosting
    of your applications.<br>
    <p> We may enter into agreements with Partner Companies such as
      hosting companies or other services providers. A Partner Company
      may want access to Application Data that we collect from its
      customers. As a result, we may provide your Application Data to a
      Partner Company on a confidential basis in order to assist the
      Partner Company in providing customer support. Because we do not
      control the privacy practices of our Partner Companies, you should
      read and understand their privacy policies.<br>
      <br>
      Orzota may disclose Application Data if it believes in good faith
      that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws
      or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Orzota; or (b)
      protect or defend the rights or property of Orzota or users of the
      Products or related services.<br>
      <br>
      Although we currently do not have a parent company, any
      subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common
      control (collectively, "Related Entities"), we may in the future.
      We may share some or all of your Application Data with these
      Related Entities, in which case we will require our Related
      Entities to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires
      our company or our assets, that company will possess the
      Application Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights
      and obligations regarding your Application Data as described in
      this Privacy Policy.<br>
      <br>
      Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally
      disclose the Application Data collected from our services to third
      parties without consent from you. You expressly consent to the
      sharing of your Application Data as described in this policy.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Security of Your Application and Personal Data</h2>
    Orzota is committed to protecting the security of your Application
    Data and Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard
    security technologies and procedures to help protect your
    Application Data and Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or
    disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your
    account information. Please do not disclose your account password to
    unauthorized people. Despite these measures, you should know that
    Orzota cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with
    Application Data and Personal Data and mistakes and security
    breaches may happen.<br>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Orzota uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide
      the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
      technology required to run the Orzota Data Management Platform.
      Although Orzota owns the code, databases, and all rights to the
      Orzota application, you retain all rights to your own data and
      applications (aka jobs) that you run on the Orzota platform.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Disclosure</h2>

      <li>Orzota may disclose personally identifiable information under
        special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when
        your actions violate the <a href="http://orzota.com/tos.html">Terms




          of Service</a>.</li>
    </ul>
